\section*{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}

This manual will guide you through a clean Windows 7 installation process. It
will also focus on creation of the installation medium as well as installing
common software. Most recommendations described in this manual are personal
preferences of the author. Even though this manual is aimed to install Windows
on a virtual machine, it can also be used for installations on a \emph{real}
machine.
